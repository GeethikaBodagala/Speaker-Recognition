# Speaker-Recognition
Speaker recognition is the task of identifying a person from their voice. This project extracts MFCC features from audio files and uses a CNN to classify the speaker. The project includes implementations in both Python and MATLAB.
The dataset consists of audio recordings of multiple speakers, each stored in separate directories.
